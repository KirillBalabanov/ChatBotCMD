1) Setting server:
---Run client.jar.
---Server settings would be exported to settings\settings.txt ( this server settings uses by client to connect to
server )

2) Client usage:
---Make sure 'settings\settings.txt' in relative path to client.jar is filled with ip address and port of server (
every setting starts with new line )
---Run client.jar and follow the instructions.


If .jar files doesn't open create .bat next to .jar file containing this:
java -jar JarFileName.jar --- where JarFileName is either client or server.
